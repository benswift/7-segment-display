# 7-segment display
## Part of the Cybernetic Studio's _Human-Scale AI_ project

Notebooks and other resources for hacking on an AI-powered 7-segment display
"recogniser". Just one file in here at present, which is written in Elixir and
requires [livebook](https://livebook.dev) to run.

Note: this is a work in progress. If you're interested in what's going on, get
in touch with [Ben](mailto:ben.swift@anu.edu.au).
